# Base64 (10 pts)

**Category:** General — Encoding
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Challenge

Decode a hex string to bytes, then encode it as Base64.

---

## Vulnerability

Base64 encodes binary data using 64 printable ASCII characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /). It's used when binary data must be transmitted over text-based protocols.

**Key insight:** Base64 increases data size by ~33% (3 bytes become 4 characters) but ensures safe transmission through any text channel.

## Solution

```python
import base64

hex_string = "72bca9b68fc16ac7beeb8f849dca1d8a783e8acf9679bf9269f7bf"

# Hex → bytes → Base64
raw_bytes = bytes.fromhex(hex_string)
b64_encoded = base64.b64encode(raw_bytes).decode()
print(b64_encoded)
```

## Key Takeaway

**Base64 is encoding, not encryption.** It provides no security—anyone can decode it. Common uses include:
- Email attachments (MIME)
- Data URLs in HTML/CSS
- JWT tokens
- PEM-formatted keys and certificates

Always use `base64.b64encode()` for bytes and `base64.b64decode()` to reverse.
